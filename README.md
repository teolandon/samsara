# samsara
A Samsara compiler in OCaml. Also an assignment repo for CSC-312
Language Implementation with Peter Michael Osera. By Theo Kalfas.

## simplecli
A simple exercise in CLI construction in OCaml.

simplecli takes an amount of arguments and prints them out in order, one in
each line. It also supports two command flags:

* _-length_ -- prints out the lengths of the arguments instead of the arguments
    themselves.
* _-help_ -- prints out a usage message for simplecli.
